## 🔋 5. Leakage Behavior with Body Biasing

A VSB sweep from **0 to -90 mV** shows large impact on leakage.

| Body Voltage | Leakage Current | Observation                  |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| -90 mV       | 160 pA          | Minimum leakage (strong RBB) |
| -40 mV       | 520 pA          | Moderate leakage             |
| -10 mV       | 898 pA          | High leakage                 |
| 0 mV         | Maximum         | Worst case                   |

### **Observations:**

* Reverse Body Bias (RBB) **increases Vth** → leakage drops
